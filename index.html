			 	<h3>About Me</h3>
			 	<p>Hi! My name is <span class="bolded">Federico</span>. 
			 	<br>
			 	I am a student at the <span class="bolded">University of Waterloo</span> studying math and physics, and I have just finished my second year of study. I have a passion for learning new concepts in these areas, and also have an interest in learning new applicable skills, such as fixing bikes and appliances, coding, and music.<br><br>
			 	I like to lead an active lifestyle, and I much enjoy outdoor activities such as biking, hiking, and climbing rocks.<br><br>
			 	I fluently speak three languages: English, Italian, and Farsi (Persian).<br><br>
			 	Since I have a passion for understanding math and physics concepts, I have also developed a strong interest in teaching these concepts to students and helping them succeed. More information on this can be found on my website's <span class="intLink"  onclick=document.getElementById("tab4").click()>Tutoring</span> tab.

			 	<h3>Academics</h3>
			 	<p>I am a student currently enrolled at the <span class="bolded">University of Waterloo</span> in Honours Mathematics, on the road to declaring my major in <span class="bolded">Mathematical Physics</span>.
			 	<br>
			 	I have been on the <a href=https://uwaterloo.ca/math/current-undergraduates/funding-and-awards/deans-honours-list target="_blank">Term Dean's Honours List</a> for all of my school terms so far.

			 	Outside of school, I have also participated in academically enlightening experiences, and also have had much experience inpiring students to learn.
			 	<br>
			 	Academic extracurricular schools I've attended:<br>
			 	<a href=http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/students/programs/international-summer-school-young-physicists target="_blank">ISSYP</a> at the <span class="bolded">Perimeter insitute for Theoretical Physics</span><br>

			 	<h3>Tutoring</h3>
			 	<p>From my own passion in understanding concepts in math and physics, I have always been trying to help other students succeed. I find great joy in inspiring students to develop an interest in and possibly pursue mathematics. Math concepts are so strongly interlinked that any gaps in a student's understanding will hinder them greatly. As a tutor, it is my job to find those gaps and try to fill them, so that the student may succeed with their coursework and exams.<br>
			 	<br>
			 	I currently offer tutoring in: <span class="bolded">Lower Mainland, B.C.</span><br>
			 	<br>
			 	My rates are:<br>
			 	<br>
			 	One-on-one tutoring:<br>
			 	$25/hour-$30/hour
			 	<br><br>
			 	Group sessions:<br>
			 	$10/hour-$20/hour<br>
			 	<br>
			 	The subjects I offer are:<br>
			 	<br>
			 	University Level:<br>
			 	Calculus 1, 2, and 3<br>
			 	Physics 1<br>
			 	Algebra 1<br>
<br><br>
			 	High School Level:<br>
			 	Calculus and AP Calculus<br>
			 	Math 8 to 12<br>
			 	<br><br>
			 	Note that my rates are dependent on course, session length, and number of group members (if any). For an exact quote feel free to contact me on my <span class="intLink"  onclick=document.getElementById("tab5").click()>Contact</span> tab.
