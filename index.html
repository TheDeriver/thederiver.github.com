			 	<h3>About Me</h3>
			 	<p>Hi! My name is <span class="bolded">Federico</span>. 
			 	<br>
			 	I am a recent graduate from the <span class="bolded">University of Waterloo</span>, where I majored in Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics with a Specialization in Physics. I have such a passion for learning math that I decided to go for round two and enroll in a Masters of Science at <span class="bolded">Simon Fraser University</span>, studying Combinatorics. I also enjoy learning new applicable skills, such as fixing bikes and cars, learning to code, and playing music.<br><br>
			 	I spend a lot of my time outside doing activities such as biking, hiking, camping, and rock climbing.<br><br>
			 	I fluently speak three languages: English, Italian, and Farsi (Persian).<br><br>
			 	I like math and physics so much that I can't help but want to teach others about it every chance I get, and so I often tutor students in those subject and helping them succeed with their courses. More information on this can be found in the <span class="intLink"  onclick=document.getElementById("tab4").click()>Tutoring</span> tab.

			 	<h3>Academics</h3>
			 	<p>
			 	I am currently a Master's student in the <a href=https://www.sfu.ca/math/graduate.html target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> at <span class="bolded">Simon Fraser University</span> studying <span class="bolded">Combinatorics</span> under the supervision of Professor <a href=http://people.math.sfu.ca/~jed/ target="_blank">Jonathan Jedwab</a>.
			 	<br><br>
			 	I completed my undergraduate degree at <span class="bolded">University of Waterloo</span>, majoring in <a href=https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Pure-Mathematics target="_blank">Pure Mathematics</a> and <a href=https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-AM-Degree-Requirements-Applied-Mathematics target="_blank">Applied Mathematics</a> with a <a href=https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-AM-Physics-Specialization target="_blank">Specialization in Physics</a>.
			 	I have graduated with distinction.
			 	<br /><br />
			 	Outside of school, I have also participated in a some interesting summer camps.
			 	<br><br>
			 	Academic extracurricular schools I've attended:<br>

			 	<h3>Tutoring</h3>
			 	<p>I have always been trying to help other students succeed in math and physics, since I think they are such amazing topics. These topics are often so poorly covered in high school that students never develop a good foundation for solving the kinds of problems that arise in these courses. I love inspiring students to develop an interest in mathematics and physics.<br>
			 	<br>
			 	I currently offer tutoring in: <span class="bolded"> The Lower Mainland</span><br> region of British Columbia
			 	<br>
			 	My rates are:<br>
			 	<br>
			 	One-on-one tutoring:<br>
			 	$45
			 	<br><br>
			 	Group sessions:<br>
			 	$15/hour/person-$30/hour/person<br>
			 	<br>
			 	The subjects I tutor are:<br>
			 	<br>
			 	University Level:<br>
			 	Calculus 1, 2, and 3<br>
			 	Physics 1 and 2<br>
			 	Linear Algebra 1 and 2
			 	Proofs
			 	<br><br>
			 	High School Level:<br>
			 	Calculus and AP Calculus<br>
			 	Precalculus<br>
			 	Math Foundations<br>
			 	Physics<br>
			 	<br><br>
			 	Note that my rates are dependent on course, session length, and number of group members (if any). For an exact quote feel free to <span class="intLink"  onclick=document.getElementById("tab5").click()>contact</span> me.
